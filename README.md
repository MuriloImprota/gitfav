This project is a modified version of the GitHub_Favorites project, now using the SPA model and with comments explaining the functionalities and operation of the program. In this software project, it consists of an application that uses GitHub's own API to retrieve data such as username, name, repositories, and followers, allowing the deletion of any searched user from the display table, and when all users are deleted, another page will be displayed.
